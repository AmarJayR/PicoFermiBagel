# PicoFermiBagel
Math game branched off of traditional PicoFermiBagel game. Made when I was 12.


The goal of the game is to guess a number based on the hints. The hints are:

* Fermi: A digit was placed in the correct spot
* Pico: A correct digit was placed in an incorrect spot
* Bagel: No digits were placed correctly.

For example if the correct number was 123 and I guessed 132 the hint would be "Fermi Pico" (I placed one digit in the correct spot and one digit in an incorrect spot). However, had I guessed 456 the hint would have been "Bagel" because none of those digits were in the correct number.

The game starts with a 3 digit number with an option to increase this digits and make the game more complex.
